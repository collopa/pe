# pe

Here, I hope to solve some of the PE problems in my spare time. I'm hoping to solve each problem using three different languages: Mathematica, Python3, and Julia. Mathematica because it is a great language that I fell in love with in college. Python, because, it's all the rage these days. Julia because I'm convinced it's the future.
